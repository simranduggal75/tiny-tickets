## Postman Collection

A ready-to-use Postman collection is included:
backend/postman/TinyTickets.postman_collection.json

Import this into Postman to test the endpoints directly.


### How to Use

1. Open Postman → 'Import' → select the above JSON file.
2. The collection will appear with 5 folders:
   - **Auth** → Register & Login
   - **Projects** → Manage projects & members
   - **Tickets** → Create, list (with filters), details, update, delete
   - **Comments** → Add & list comments on tickets
   - **Labels** → Manage labels and attach/detach from tickets
3. Set the following collection variables in Postman:
   - 'baseUrl' = http://localhost:5088
   - 'token' = paste the JWT you get from `POST /auth/login`  
   - 'projectId', 'ticketId', 'labelId' = automatically saved from create APIs (via test scripts) or set manually
4. All requests are pre-configured to use:

Authorization: Bearer {{token}}

Make sure you set your token before running protected requests.


### Example Workflow

1. **Auth** → Register → Login → copy `token` into collection variable.  
2. **Projects** → Create project → Add member → List projects.  
3. **Tickets** → Create ticket → List tickets with filters → Update ticket → Delete ticket.  
4. **Comments** → Add comment to a ticket → List comments.  
5. **Labels** → Create label → Attach label to ticket → Detach label.
