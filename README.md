## Postman Collection

A ready-to-use Postman collection is included:
backend/postman/TinyTickets.postman_collection.json

Import this into Postman to test the endpoints directly.




## frontend steup

The frontend is built with Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS. It connects to the backend API.

1. Move into the frontend folder

cd frontend

2. Install dependencies

npm install

3. Create environment file

Copy .env.example to .env.local (or create manually):

NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5088

This must point to your backend API.

4. Start the frontend dev server

npm run dev

By default, the app runs on http://localhost:3000.


---

## Frontend Features

Auth Pages: Register, Login, Logout

Projects: List projects, view details, create new projects

Members: Add members to projects, role-based access (OWNER / MEMBER)

Tickets: Full CRUD (create, edit, delete), assign to project members

Comments: Add and view comments on tickets

Labels: Project-level labels management

UI: Clean responsive UI with Tailwind tables & buttons, consistent with backend roles/permissions



---

 Once both backend and frontend are running:

Backend API ‚Üí http://localhost:5088

Frontend App ‚Üí http://localhost:3000


Login via frontend will store JWT in localStorage and automatically attach it to API requests.
### How to Use

1. Open Postman ‚Üí 'Import' ‚Üí select the above JSON file.
2. The collection will appear with 5 folders:
   - **Auth** ‚Üí Register & Login
   - **Projects** ‚Üí Manage projects & members
   - **Tickets** ‚Üí Create, list (with filters), details, update, delete
   - **Comments** ‚Üí Add & list comments on tickets
   - **Labels** ‚Üí Manage labels and attach/detach from tickets
3. Set the following collection variables in Postman:
   - 'baseUrl' = http://localhost:5088
   - 'token' = paste the JWT you get from POST /auth/login' 
   - 'projectId', 'ticketId', 'labelId' = automatically saved from create APIs (via test scripts) or set manually
4. All requests are pre-configured to use:

Authorization: Bearer {{token}}

Make sure you set your token before running protected requests.


### Example Workflow

1. **Auth** ‚Üí Register ‚Üí Login ‚Üí copy 'token' into collection variable.  
2. **Projects** ‚Üí Create project ‚Üí Add member ‚Üí List projects.  
3. **Tickets** ‚Üí Create ticket ‚Üí List tickets with filters ‚Üí Update ticket ‚Üí Delete ticket.  
4. **Comments** ‚Üí Add comment to a ticket ‚Üí List comments.  
5. **Labels** ‚Üí Create label ‚Üí Attach label to ticket ‚Üí Detach label.
